## Description:
This C++ program on SNAKE AND LADDER GAME is a simple text base game. I have used **procedure oriented method** to design this game. I have not included any graphics in this project, as my motto is to design the logic without any flaws. 

#### Rules:

Two players can play this game and the player who cross 100 first is the winner.


### Concepts Used:

In this project, I have used programming concepts like 
-switch..case, 
-call by reference, 
-library function like randomize(), 
-random() etc. 

This project helped me to practice C++ programming.
